      <p><strong>Here are some recommendations on Linkedin from my colleagues over time:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mosab is deft and friendly geek whom I've known for over a decade before finally working together in
the same team.</p>
<p>Mosab possesses an impressive in-depth knowledge powered by relentless desire to dissect and
understand the core of every technology he touches. This prowess allows him to easily digest new
technologies and paradigms, ask the right questions, and to excel at managing systems on a large
scale. Combining that knowledge with agility gives him the gift of quickly changing lanes with no
discourse. Mosab has done that while maintaining a very positive attitude during the toughest times.</p>
<p>It was a true pleasure working with Mosab on daily basis. I would seize the opportunity to work with
him again</p>

billion transactions a day. His in-depth technical knowledge helped to overcome a number of complex
scenarios when dealing with high load traffic in a distributed micro service system.</p>
<p>On a personal note, Mosab was always a delightful conversationalist brining insightful topics which
lead to highly stimulating exchanges outside of work settings.</p>
