   The first ever personal computer that I owned, more than a couple decades ago!\n  \n\nI am a resourceful and passionate Software &amp; Systems Engineer with two decades of experience, I have honed my skills in\ndesigning, developing, operating, and maintaining software systems at various scales. My expertise spans multiple\nindustries and domains, and I am particularly passionate about Developing Large-scale Systems, Linux, Databases, Systems\nProgramming, Distributed Systems, and Automation at Scale, as well as Free Software and Open-source Software.\nThroughout my career I have worked in the capacity of a Production Engineer at Meta/Facebook, where\nI focused on improving the availability, scalability, performance, and reliability of our production services. Prior to\nthat, I worked at Twitter, where I was dedicated to giving everyone the power to create and share\nideas and information instantly without barriers. I have also held positions at GoCardless,\nLevelset, Wuzzuf, Inmobly, 20@, and other\ngreat companies.\n\nThroughout my career, I have consistently sought out opportunities to push my own boundaries and continue learning and\ngrowing as a Software &amp; Systems Engineer. I am always looking for new challenges and ways to improve my skills, whether\nit's through taking on complex projects or seeking out new training and education. My passion for the field drives me to\nstay at the forefront of industry developments and to continuously seek out new ways to make an impact. As I move\nforward in my career, I am excited to continue pushing myself to new heights, making meaningful contributions, and\ndeveloping innovative solutions to complex problems.\n\nWhen not working, you can find me spending time with my lovely family or on my hobbies of\nreading, cycling, DIY projects, cooking and\nwoodworking.\nHere are a couple pictures of the child me over the years!\n\n\n\n    A young version of me eating a sandwich and drinking a fizzy drink at the same time!\n  \n\n\n\n    Baraa, my life best friend, and I in our first documented protest\n  \n\n\n\n    Baraa and I in our favourite cafe (sorry for the fuzzy image, phones at the time didn't have good cameras!).\n  \n\n\n\n    The first burger that I paid for with my first salary writing code.\n  \n\n","description":"","id":"https://mosab.co.uk/about/","path":"/about/","title":"About"},"https://mosab.co.uk/blog/":{"body":"","description":"","id":"https://mosab.co.uk/blog/","path":"/blog/","title":"Blog Posts"},"https://mosab.co.uk/blog/2018-state-of-the-union/":{"body":"\nThe last year, 2018, has been a very busy year for me, I barely had a break! I\nam going to list what has been accomplished, and important milestones very\nbriefly in the following few paragraphs.\nWork and Career\nJava in Production\nIn November 2017, I joined an adtech company in Berlin, Germany to work on their\nad delivery server which was written in PHP and used technologies like Nginx,\nMongoDB, and Redis. Most of the work was bug fixing, and little was about adding\nnew features. The project quickly became very boring, and any attempt to enhance\nit, or refactor any part of it was rejected and foiled. Early last year, I\nswitched to another interesting project that was being built from scratch. This\ntime the project was built using the Java programming language, and the Vert.x\nframework was used. Later Spring framework was used for most of the\nmicroservices involved in the project. In both cases, this was my first time to\ndevelop, maintain and deploy Java code to production.\nScalability\nBack in Egypt, the most traffic I have dealt with was around 100K requests per\nweek! Looking to work on projects that handled large amounts of traffic was one\nof the main reasons I moved to Germany.\nThe PHP project was handling 100K requests per hour, compared to the maximum I\nhad in Egypt that was a big step forward. But the production footprint of the\njava project kept growing month over month till we reached a milestone of\nhandling more than 1 billion requests per day. It was a very exciting\njourney, and I learned a lot from it in terms of teams, companies and systems\nscalability.\nThe Year of The Good Reads\n\nThis year, I started with a pledge to read 10 books on the annual Good Reads\nchallenge. I ended up reading 18\nbooks! The books were\nmainly in the following areas\n\nLinux internals/kernel books\nData structures and algorithms\nPython programming\nLinux systems programming\nGo programming\nJava programming\nA couple of non-fiction books, two of them about startups\n\nOne of the achievements I am particularly proud of is reading the entire\n\"Systems Performance: Enterprise and the\nCloud\" by Brendan Gregg, in a\nsingle weekend!\nNew Personal Library\nSpeaking of reading, one of the things that I really missed the most after\nmoving out of Egypt is my personal library. I had to take only a small portion\nof it with me. But I managed to grow this portion into a little library over the\npast year and 2 months. I have expanded both the hard copy books, my Kindle book\ncollection, and ebooks from other sources like Packt Publishing.\n\nThe year of “Finished” Online Courses\nFor the past few years, I have always started, but not finished, a lot of online\ncourses and MOOCs. This year, however, I managed to start and actually finish\nmore than 15 courses, on platforms like Stanford’s Engineering\nEverywhere,\nPluralSight,\nEducative, Udemy, and\neven some Youtube playlists for courses by MIT, Waterloo, &amp; Carnegie Mellon\nuniversities. You can find some of the interesting ones listed on my homepage.\nIt is worth noting that not all the courses on my resources\npage I have finished yet, but I found\ninteresting enough to share with others.\nTechnologies and Skills\nIn 2018, I have acquired some completely new technical skills/technologies, as\nwell as worked on improving some existing ones.\nThe list of new technologies include:\n\nGolang\nJava\nSpring Framework\nVert.x Framework\nTerraform\nMongoDB\nRedis\nKafka\nAerospike\n\nThe technologies and skills I was keen on improving include:\n\nLinux internals, linux administration and linux troubleshooting\nPython\nPHP\nBash\nDocker\nDocker Swarm\n\nPyPI Package\nTowards the end of 2018, I published a silly Python package:\ndir2html. The package converts a folder of\nimages, into an HTML album using a Bootstrap template. Here is an example of how\nit looks like after the album has been generated: Mosab’s Bitmoji\nAlbum. There is a list of improvements and\nfeatures to be added to the project, but they are not the top priority.\nJob Interviews\nBoy did I have tons of interviews in 2018! Before leaving Egypt, I was targeting\nto move to London, and if that didn’t work, I had Amsterdam as a backup plan. So\nin 2017, I did a lot of interviews for companies in both cities, as well as a\ncouple of stray interviews for companies in other cities like Paris. When the\nfirst round didn’t yield a job offer in either, I started to believe that those\ncompanies required a significantly higher experience than I had at the time. The\ncompanies included Booking.com, Facebook, and Criteo Labs. Of course, all of\nthem dealt with insanely high amounts of traffic and required a very deep\nunderstanding of more than just programming since I was also looking to switch\nto a Site Reliability Engineering role at the time. I have worked in startups\nmost of my career and wanted to work with big companies, but it seemed I had to\nup my game first before trying again.\nIn order to acquire this experience, I decided to start targeting companies in\nbetween and started looking into other geographical locations like Germany,\nuntil I landed a job at an adtech company in Berlin and worked on projects like\nthe mentioned above. I set a goal for the year to see whether Germany would be\nwhere my family and I decide to settle. Turns out, Germany is not for me for\nreasons that can be detailed in another future post, maybe. With that\nconviction, I set on a new round of interviews again with Facebook, Booking, and\nother companies, Mainly in London and Amsterdam again. There was one exception\nof N26, an amazing bank of the future that is located in Berlin. I also had\ninterviews with Google for the same role.\nThe interview round yielded two offers, one from Booking, and one from a very\npromising fintech startup in London, which I accepted. Both offers were decent\nand choosing between them was a tough thing to do.\nI did not pass Facebook and Google interviews, but I did learn a lot. In\nparticular, I was in a way better shape for the second facebook interview than\nthe one I had in 2017, and I feel confident I am close to passing it. The\nFacebook interviews were for the Production Engineering role, which is -in the\nwords of a dear Production Engineer &amp; friend- a software engineer + a systems\nengineer + a networks engineer. Those interviews are really tough.\nBut at the moment, I am preparing to move to London, finally! And as exhausting\nas the move is, even though we have not yet got the rest of the visas, it is\nalso extremely exciting!\nIELTS Test\nAs part of the visa process for the UK, I had to take an English language test,\nIELTS short for The International English Language Testing System. Ironically\nenough, I didn’t find a suitable appointment in Germany, and the version of the\ntest that is approved by the UKVI (United Kingdom Visa and Immigration) is only\nconducted in Dusseldorf, Germany, which is a 4 hours trip, or a one hour flight\nfrom Berlin where I live. I looked for appointments in other cities, like\nAmsterdam, Paris, and London, since my short stay visa was still valid. I ended\nup taking the test in London.\nThe score I got was an overall band of 7, which translates to a C1 level in the\nCommon European Framework of Reference for languages, or CEFR for short. Not\nbad, I guess, but I hoped to score better. Most importantly, it satisfies the UK\nvisa requirements, so I can improve that later.\nPersonal Stuff\nCities Visited\nIn 2018, I visited London 3 times, twice for interviews, and once to take the\nIELTS exam. The city never ceases to amaze me. I am deeply in love with it. In\none of the trips, I visited the Museum of Science where I saw parts of the\nApollo mission -among other things- that was absolutely mesmerizing, had fish\nand chips at “Sherlock” restaurant in Baker Street, had Egyptian pies, and\noverall great times.\n\nThere was also a magical weekend that was well spent in Vienna, Austria. A\nfriend of mine was visiting another country in Europe, and we spontaneously\nagreed to meet in Vienna for a weekend. A friend of his was amazing and gave us\nshelter at his house, and took great care of us during the entire visit.\n\nDuring the 4 days trip to Amsterdam for the second interview at Booking, I took\nsome time to meet some friends in Amsterdam. I also visited Haarlem since it is\na popular residential place for families and met another friend living there who\ntook me on a tour of the city. The Netherlands is always a delight to visit.\n\nFirst Tax Declaration!\nIn Egypt, the situation is so messed up that many companies do not report the\nactual salaries of their employees in order to skip paying some of the tax and\nsocial insurance money. Since employees are not required, nor have the incentive\nto declare their income for tax purposes, most companies get away with it. Most\nof the companies I worked with were on the law-abiding side, but still, I\npersonally did not have to declare my income for the tax authorities. This has\nchanged in Germany. Last year was the first year I file my taxes, and I even got\nsome refunds! The refunds didn’t last long as they were used to fund my family’s\nvisit to Egypt a few months after they arrived in Germany, but still, that was a\ngreat thing to happen.\nFirst Fine!\nIn the first few months, I was experimenting with public transportation tickets\nin order to decide what was best for me. I decided on the second month that I\nwill start buying monthly tickets until I figured out how to move forward. One\nday, 3months into buying monthly tickets, I hopped into the underground, and a\nfew inspectors boarded the train. When the inspector came to me, I pulled out my\nmonthly ticket, the inspector looked at it and started speaking in German. I was\nconfused. No inspector ever spoke before, except to maybe say \"Danke schön\",\nwhich mean \"Thank you\". Then I realized the ticket had expired THE DAY\nBEFORE! I had to pay a fine of 63 euros. That day I signed up for the annual\ncard in order to avoid this situation in the future, and they charge my bank\naccount every month without requiring me to intervene.\nNew Laptop Sticker\n\nThis year, I bought a new personal laptop, and of course, needed some stickers\nto decorate it. I bought some stickers from Sticker Mule and got others from\nmeetups. I am happy with the current status, but I am looking forward to adding\nnew stickers to the collections.\nCooking Adventures\nThe Germans have a really poor taste in food and most of the restaurants are\n“Germanized”, thus most of the food experience in Germany isn’t something to\nlook forward to. Given that I finally started having some work/life balance, I\nstarted looking for recipes online and trying my luck with cooking. The majority\nof the recipes I cook come from Asian cuisines because I believe they know how\nto eat best. I spend a lot of time searching for a recipe that I can actually\nfollow, which is an exhausting task, then it is easy getting the ingredients\nfrom the supermarkets around. Sometimes, I have to go to ethnic stores to buy\nspecific spices or herbs, but overall the ingredients abundance situation is way\nbetter than it was back in Egypt. You can find some pictures of the recipes I\ncooked on my Instagram account.\nOur Lovely Neighbours\nThe first two months I was in Berlin, I was assigned a temporary guest house to\nstay in until I found a more permanent accommodation for my family and myself. A\nlot of friends recommended a company that rented furnished apartments, and after\na few calls and emails which the HR helped me with, I got the apartment. At this\npoint, my wife was still in Cairo. She was communicating with one of her friends\nwho turns out lives in the same exact building we are moving into! That was such\na great coincidence, and we had a great year together. They got our backs in\ncountless occasions, often on short notice. Thank you, neighbours/friends!\nA Friend Visited from Egypt\n\nIn 2018, my friend Osama visited me from Egypt as part of a Euro-trip he had.\nUnfortunately, we coudln’t spend as much time together as we hoped to because of\nall the interviews I had coinciding with the visit. Let’s see what the future\nholds.\nAmazing New Friends\nThroughout the past year, I got to know some amazing new friends. I also got to\nspend a lot more time with old friends I barely met back in Egypt. Some of them\nI got the privilege of working with them, either in the same company, or the\nsame team. For that, I am ever thankful. I will miss them a lot after moving\nout.\nAdam, School and The German Language\nMy son, Adam, was afraid at first not being able to speak German and how that\nwill affect his relationship with his colleagues at school. Turns out, he\nlearned the fastest of us all and became very fluent in German. He especially\nenjoys the playgrounds that seem to be everywhere in Berlin. That’s not the case\nin Egypt, where you have to buy very expensive memberships in exclusive clubs in\norder to have someplace for your kids to play. Adam acquired a lot of friends,\nand he is very happy at school.\nHealth Adventures\nThe year 2018 had a lot of health-related stories. I had a tooth removed,\nleaving a big gap in my mouth. I had a surgery to remove some extra skin that\nlooked suspicious but turned out to be nothing serious. I also had my first ever\nambulance ride when I suspected having a blood clot because I travelled to\nLondon a few days after the surgery. I was held in the hospital for a few hours\nbut was cleared shortly after.\nBut that’s nothing compared with the two times my daughter, Sofia, had us rush\nher into the ER. The first was a few days after they have arrived in Berlin, on\nthe day we were supposed to register them. She fell off the bed and hit her head\nthen threw up, which is a sign of a potential concussion. We immediately\ncancelled the appointment and went to the first hospital that appeared on Google\nmaps.\nThe second time was when she decided she wanted a just-poured cup of tea and\ngrabbed it from the table very quickly leading it to spill on her arm. She got a\nsecond-degree burn that we are still treating, but she has passed the danger\nzone, and feels no pain, thank God!\nOverall, I admire the health care system in Germany and most European countries,\nalthough, sometimes you really have to wait to get some care.\nChess!\nI started playing chess online, after\nso many years of not doing so. I finished the year with a 900 score, and I\nintend to continue playing this year.\nNew Year’s Eve Fireworks\nMy family and I have attended two New Year’s Eve fireworks nights. Most people\nliving in Berlin complain about how loud the noise is, but given that I have\nspent many days on the streets protesting in Egypt’s 2011 revolution, in the\nmidst of real bullets fired at us, tear gas bombs, and other stuff, the\nfireworks noise wasn’t much to handle. Adam enjoyed it very much though both\nyears. Sofia enjoyed it the first time but was absolutely terrified the second\ntime that Amira had to stay home with her, while I accompanied Adam on the\nstreet.\nThings I Miss in Egypt\nA lot of my friends here kept telling me that by the end of the year I will miss\nEgypt again. Truth is, I have not. Not even a little. I only miss very few\nthings there:\n\nMy brothers, and few members of my family, and my wife’s family\nA few friends from work and otherwise\nA few restaurants\n\nMany of my friends say the weather here is gloomy, but the weather here is one\nof the things I like, and of the reasons I moved here.\nI do not feel homesick, and I don’t think I will soon either.\nThe Next Year\nWe are only a few weeks into 2019, and a lot is going on already! My family and\nI are preparing to move to London where I will join a very promising fintech\nstartup in the capacity of a Site Reliability Engineer. It is going to be a\nchallenging yet an exciting year, and I hope it goes well without any unwanted\nsurprises. I am excited!\n","description":"","id":"https://mosab.co.uk/blog/2018-state-of-the-union/","path":"/blog/2018-state-of-the-union/","title":"2018: State of the Union"},"https://mosab.co.uk/blog/caffeine-code-cycle/":{"body":"I saw this quote and loved it:\n\nDevelopers are living organisms that convert Caffeine into code!\n-- Source Unknown\n\nSo I made this diagram :\n\n","description":"","id":"https://mosab.co.uk/blog/caffeine-code-cycle/","path":"/blog/caffeine-code-cycle/","title":"Caffeine Code Cycle"},"https://mosab.co.uk/blog/firefox-power-close/":{"body":"I open a lot of tabs on firefox, and I mean A LOT!

Was riding in Tour De\nRicky audax, and it was a challenging route for me. Took me 7 hours and 22 minutes of riding (10\nhours if you include the cafe and rest stops) but I did it!\nDistance: 119.8 km\nElevation Gain: 1134 m\nTime: 7h 22m\n\nSome lessons I learned from this ride are (in a very raw format, will iterate on them later):\n\n\nI needed specific recommendations in regards to what to wear, and most resources talk guidelines,\nwhich is something you don't want for the first few rides. In order to be able to take a guideline,\nyou need to have tried a few rides in different conditions first. I wanted specifics (like wear a\nbibshort if it 10 degrees celsius or above, etc).\n\n\nI definitely need more gears for those hills\n\n\nIt was great knowing my FTP, as I could only finish the ride by actively trying to keep my power\nbelow the FTP especially on those hill.\n3.1. That required better shifting for the gears, and that's something I have always heard, but never\nreally understood\n3.2. I also don't know if I was crossing the chains, will need to see\n3.3. This is one of the areas that people might benefit from videos on how to change the gears and in\nwhat order just like car drivers have\n\n\nI DEFINITELY need to increase my FTP\n\n\nI was lucky that I did not have any punctures, or mechanicals, but it was assuring that I got tools\nwith me\n\n\nThe back bag probably shouldn't have been there (over worrying about the weather made me pack extra\njust in case)\n\n\nI probably should've taken the power bank. Phones almost died at the end\n\n\nI had a rear freehub that needs changing (there is play in the cassette) but there is nothing I\ncould do about it, as the part was delivered right before the ride. Was afraid it fails on me during\nthe ride, and paid extra attention not to put sudden impact on the drivetrain, luckily it didn't\nfail!\n\n\nHaving the route on multiple devices was helpful\n\n\nCycling navigation experience could use a lot of improvement. This is not a solved problem yet.\n\n\nInvesting in a bike fit was one of the best things I did! Can't imagine doing this distance with the\noriginal bike setup I got!\n\n\nServicing the bike, and changing the worn chain was also a contributing factor to minimise the risk\nof getting a mechanical, I guess!\n\n\nI should've planned the transportation to and from the start/finish point better! That cost me a\nlate start, and because of that I ended up doing the whole route alone instead of doing it with a\nbunch of fellow colleagues, but that's ok.\n\n\n\nHere is a video about the ride:\n\n  \n\n","description":"","id":"https://mosab.co.uk/blog/first-metric-century/","path":"/blog/first-metric-century/","title":"My First Metric Century"},"https://mosab.co.uk/blog/how-to-install-firefox-on-debian-jessie/":{"body":"\nIceweasel is great, but I prefer Firefox.\nA while back I decided to go back to my favorite linux distribution, Debian.\nThe current stable release of Debian is code named Jessie, and this is what\nI have installed on my laptop at the time of writing this post.\nMozilla has three famous desktop applications. Those applications are Firefox,\nThunderbird, and Seamonkey. But Debian has been shipping those products\nre-branded as Iceweasel, Icdeodove, and Iceape, respectively. Debian\ndoes this as a workaround for some incompatibilities between the Debian Free\nSoftware Guidelines and Mozilla’s trademark usage policy, and I think something\nrelated to the Mozilla logos licensing as well. I am not aware of the details of\nthe conflicts, and I would like to read about it some other time.\nFor now, I wanted to install Firefox instead of, or alongside, Iceweasel on my\nlaptop. Iceweasel is great, but I was having a few problems. One example would\nbe the different User Agent information, which causes some problems while using\nservices on the internet, like Medium. Medium does not recognize my browser to be\nsupported, and thus disables the option of writing stories if I am browsing it\nusing Iceweasel.\nI did a quick Google search on how to install Firefox on Debian Jessie,\nand a majority of the results suggested adding repositories from Ubuntu\npackages hosted on Sourceforge. I had two major problems with that:\nProblem 1: I don’t like Sourceforge. At all. For various reasons, but that’s\na story for another time.\nProblem 2: I don’t like the idea of adding the repositories of another\ndistro to my current setup. Does not seem like a neat solution.\nSo I kept searching until I found this “Debian Mozilla team” page. I\nknew I found my desired solution.\nBelow are the steps I followed from that page to get Firefox installed on\nDebian Jessie.\nStep 1: Add Mozilla Archive to APT Repositories\nOpen a terminal as root, and add a new file to /etc/apt/sources.list.d/\ndirectory:\n\nOpen the file using your favorite text editor, mine happens to be vim, and add\nthe following line to it:\n\nStep 2: Add the Mozilla Archive Key\nThis line adds mozilla.debian.net archive to your list of archives. Since the\npackages at mozilla.debian.net are signed, running apt-get update now will\nspit out a key not found error. To add the key you need to download the\npkg-mozilla-archive-keyring\npackage, and install it. The package requires that debian-keying package be\ninstalled.\n\nStep 3: Install Firefox\nNow it is time to update the archives and install Firefox:\n\nAnd now you have Firefox installed.\nNote that Iceweasel is also still installed, and they both will use the same\nsettings and configurations. When I started Firefox, it had all the add-ons and\nsettings and even the tabs that were opened in Iceweasel, all preserved.\nCheck the mozilla.debian.net page for various\ncombinations of Debian release, Mozilla desktop application you want to\ninstall, and the version of the Mozilla desktop application you want\ninstalled.\n","description":"","id":"https://mosab.co.uk/blog/how-to-install-firefox-on-debian-jessie/","path":"/blog/how-to-install-firefox-on-debian-jessie/","title":"How To Install Firefox On Debian Jessie"},"https://mosab.co.uk/blog/installing-gdata-python-client-on-dreamhost/":{"body":"Our company's website is hosted on Dreamhost.

I ended up using mainly Vim and Sublime for a long while now,\nand my life was never easier and I was never happier! In this post however I am\ntalking about my Sublime Text Setup.\n1) Package Control\nYou don't know what sublime is really capable of until you install the \"Package\nControl\".\nThe website describes it as:\n\nA full-featured package manager that helps discovering, installing, updating\nand removing packages for Sublime Text 2. It features an automatic upgrader\nand supports GitHub, Bitbucket and a full channel/repository system.\n\nIf you are using Sublime and not using it, STOP READING &amp; NOW GO\nINSTALL IT! After that go have a look how to use it.\n2) The packages I use\nI have a list of awesome packages I use:\n\nSublimeLinter : Uses \"lint\" programs to highlight lines of code the\nlinter deems to contain (potential) errors. It also supports highlighting\nspecial annotations (for example: TODO) so that they can be quickly located.\nSideBarEnhancements : Adds lots of enhancements to default Sublime Text\nsidebar. Files and folders.\nGitHubinator : Allows you to select text in a Sublime Text 2 file, and\nsee the highlighted lines on GitHub's remote repo, if one exists.\nGit : Plugin for some git integration into Sublime Text.\nDjaneiro : Django support for Sublime Text.\nSublimeCodeIntel : Full-featured code intelligence and smart\nautocomplete engine.\nPHP-Twig : Adds support for .twig template files.\nBracketHilighter : Matches and highlights a variety of brackets for\nbetter readability.\nSublimeRope : Adds Python completions and some IDE-like functions to\nSublime Text.\njQuery : Provides help with jQuery functions.\nXdebug : Xdebug Interface for Sublime Text.\nSublimeREPL : Helps you run an interpreter inside Sublime Text for\nvarious languages (like Python, Ruby, Shell) and you can configure it to run\nothers as well.\n\nTo install any of these packages -after installing the Package Control- press\nctrl+shift+p then type install package. A list will appear with all\navailable packages to your, just click on the package you want and voila!\nI highly recommend you watch this video on Youtube : Perfect Workflow in\nSublime Text 2. It might seem very long, but it is actually divided into 10\nminutes chunks -more or less- and it is one of the best resources I have seen\nabout Sublime.\nHappy hacking/coding with Sublime :)\n","description":"","id":"https://mosab.co.uk/blog/my-sublime-text-2-setup/","path":"/blog/my-sublime-text-2-setup/","title":"My Sublime Text 2 Setup"},"https://mosab.co.uk/blog/new-version-of-firefox-power-close/":{"body":"New website, new icon, and improvements for the tab addict Firefox add-on\n\nA Brief History\nI have recently noticed that Power Close, my Firefox add-on, has reached a 1.5 K\ndownloads milestone, which is way more than what I anticipated when I first\ncreated it. It was a very small hack for a very personal itch I have, and I\nnever thought this many people had the same problem.\nThe first version published version, 0.2.1, was officially released on September\n28th, 2014, on Mozilla’s add-on portal, and a couple days before that on GitHub.\nA few bug fixes and little improvements were released since that date, and then\nI got busy with my life and work.\n\nWhat’s New\nEarlier this month, a new version 0.5.2 of the add-on was released. Here is a\nquick overview of the changes that took place.\nNew Icon\nIn older versions of the add-on, the logo used to be one of the icons designed\nby Freepik from Flat\nIcon, that was licensed under CC-BY\nLicense.\n\nIn this release, the icon used for the logo and the toolbar button is a mash of\ntwo icons from Google’s Material Design\nIcons that are published as an open source\nproject under the CC-By License.\n\nSelection Context Menu Option\nIn previous versions of the add-on, the user had to click in a non-interactive\npart of the page to see the \"close all tabs from this domain\" context menu\nitem. This caused usability issues because the option didn’t appear if you\nright click on the page while having a portion of the text selected.\nNow the same option is added to the “Selection Context Menu”, so now the user\ncan still find this option in the context menu even if they have previously\nselected some text.\nSwitched to The New Firefox Add-on SDK\nThe previous versions of the add-on were developed using the now deprecated\n“cfx” sdk provided by Mozilla for Firefox add-on developers.\nThis new version is updated to make use of the new SDK named “jpm”.\nNew website\nI have also registered a domain name for the add-on, and moved it from the\nsub-domain under my personal website power-close.mos3abof.com, where it used to\nlive, to power-close.com.\n\nThe website was given a face lift to make it more usable, but this is an early\nrelease with new enhancements and features in the backlog. The website is\nhosted on Dreamhost, and is HTTPs\nenabled using a certificate issued from Let’s\nEncrypt.\nNewsletter\nI am also starting a newsletter for a better channel of communication with the\nusers, where I consider it a matter of principal not to spam the subscribers\nwith unnecessary emails.\nYou can sign up for the newsletter on the website:\npower-close.com.\nSocial Media Presence\nI have also started a Facebook page and\ncreated a Twitter account for the add-on.\nWhat’s Next\nThe downloads number has really caught me by surprise, mainly because I have not\nput any effort to marketing it. This inspired me to dedicate more effort into\nthe project to make it more useful for the ones who are already using it.\nThis also inspired me to launch a side experiment by reading and learning about\ngrowth hacking, while applying what I learn on Power Close, and documenting my\nfindings along the way.\nI am still not 100% sure about the game plan for this experiment. If you have\nany tips, hints, or advice I would love to hear/read it.\nOr you can click on the button below and add Power Close to your firefox browser\nnow!\n\n","description":"","id":"https://mosab.co.uk/blog/new-version-of-firefox-power-close/","path":"/blog/new-version-of-firefox-power-close/","title":"New Version of Power Close"},"https://mosab.co.uk/blog/poor-mans-guide-for-monitoring-a-website-using-python/":{"body":"In one of the projects I am working on there was a problem with Apache server.\nIt went down almost on a daily basis, and we were reading the logs to get the\nbottom of the root cause.

Then we tell it some information\nabout the server we want to restart Apache on by setting the env.hosts and\nenv.passwords variables.\nThen we define a restart_apache function that we will call later to do the\nactual restart.\nThere are three main functions that are used the most, local() that runs local\ncommands, run() that runs commands on the remote server and sudo() that runs\ncommands on the remote server using sudo. Since Apache restart requires a root\nuser or sudo privileges we used the sudo() function.\nTo run a Fabric script open up your terminal and run the following command:\n\nIf you want to run it from a different directory than the fabfile.py then you\nneed to use the -f option like this :\n\nAlerting the DevOps team about the issue.\nWe can re-use the email function from the previous post on this blog Installing\nGdata Python Client on Dreamhost:\n\nPutting it all together\nI have combined all the snippets mentioned above, modified them and added some\nlogging functionality to it.\nI have it installed on /opt/fabfile.py and I have created a /opt/fab_logs\nfolder to hold the log files.\nHere is a gist with the complete script:\n\nSetting up a cron job to run the script\nNow we have a great script, and we know how to run it manually.

After his removal, the crises\nstarted to deepen.\nMorsi came to office as the president in the elections right after the\nrevolution, and in his rule the crisis took an even worse turn. It became normal\nthat electricity cuts off once a day for an hour. That was one of the main\nreasons people revolted against Morsi, and the military seized the opportunity\nand removed him from office and put the supreme court's president in his place\nfor a year. Power outages were slightly improved right after ousting Morsi, but\nthen it gradually was becoming worse and worse.\nMarshall Sisi won the next presidential elections, he is the current president\nof Egypt and now we are having 5 or more power outages a day!!! This dude is a\nbloody savage and a mass murderer and if there was any justice in the world he\nwould be considered a war criminal, but that's a story for another time!\nAnyway, things were getting a lot worse without any government official having a\nshred of decency to come up and talk to the people about it. Not an apolgy, or a\nbit of information of how bad and/or how long will this go on. Not a statement\non whatever measures the government put in place to solve this. Not a thing!!\nThen I saw this post by my\nfried Tarek Amr. He wrote that the Egyptian\nElectric Utility and Consumer Protection Regulatory Agency (EGYPTERA) has\nreleased an online meter to show the current load status on the Egyptian power\ngrid. He said that the meter did not provide any way to be processed\nprogrammatically, like an API, and he invited his fellow programmers to try and\ndo so.\n\nI liked the idea very much, and worked on a web\napplication that parses the meter data and\nprovides it as an API for other\nprogrammers to use, and open sourced the code.\nUnfortunately, EGYPTERA's load meter only shows if the power is in the \"Safe\nZone\", \"Warning Zone\" or \"Danger Zone\". It also shows the load distribution\nthroughout the day's hours. It does not show any historical data. It does not\nshow location specific load status. Just a load status on the entire power\nnetwork across Egypt!!\nAfter I released the api, I worte another script that used that api to save the\nstatus into a database on my online server withe a timestamp. I collected data\nfor the past 7 days and a half about the load status every 10 minutes.\nWhen I plotted it using D3js, the output was scary!\n\nEach row represents a day, and every block stands for an hour of the day\nstarting at 12 am and finishing at 12 am the next day.\nLoad level has a value of three :\n\nDanger (represented in red)\nWarning (represented in yellow)\nNormal (represented in green)\n\nYou can reach the load distribution graph here.\nWe were heading for the \"Dark Ages\" figuratively with all that blood spilled and\ncorrupted governments, corrupted military, corrupted judicial system, corrupted\npolice and corrupted media.

As a beginner, yet passionate cyclist, I have always been drawn to challenging myself and pushing my limits (whenever I got time away from my job and other responsibilities), and this event promises to be an unforgettable experience.\nWhat is Tour De Ricky?\nTour De Ricky is an Audax event, part of Audax UK, a organization that promotes long-distance cycling events.\nWhat is an Audax ride, you ask me? No better answer than what Audax UK's website itself has to say, from which I quote:\n\nAn Audax ride - known internationally as a Randonnée - is a cycle ride that has to be completed within a set time limit, including any stops to eat or rest. In most cases, riders have to maintain a minimum speed of 15km/h (some particularly long or hilly rides have a slightly lower minimum speed) and importantly a maximum speed of 30km/h. That's a little under 10mph and 20mph in Imperial measures.\nIt's not a race and individual riders' times are not published; if you finish within the time limit, you've succeeded.\nRiders are expected to be self-sufficient. That doesn't mean that you have to ride alone or that you can't call on the services of a village blacksmith to help weld your frame back together, should the worst happen, but you navigate for yourself and if you do have any mechanical problems along the way, it's down to you to sort them or get yourself home.\nSome rides offer food along the way; more often, you'll be finding your own sources of fuel, from cafes and pubs to village shops and service stations.\nThrow in the hills, the British weather and distances ranging from 50km to 1400km and what might have sounded like a simple bike ride becomes more of a challenge - one that is appealing to increasing numbers of cyclists year on year.\n\nYou can also watch this great video explaining what Audax is:\n\n  \n\nThe Tour De Ricky event in particular offers a range of routes, 50km, 100km, and 200km long in distance, but I have set my sights on the 200km challenge. This particular route promises a full day of excitement, with a mix of rolling hills, scenic countryside, and quiet roads.\nThe 200km Route: A Challenge Awaits\nThe 200km route is designed to test the rider's endurance and cycling skills. With a total elevation gain of 2,500 meters, I will need to be prepared for this ride, since it has been a long time with me out of the saddle, and in a relatively short period of time too (4-5 weeks). The route will take the riders through some of the most beautiful landscapes in the country, with picturesque villages, ancient woodlands, and stunning views of the surrounding countryside.\nWhy I'm Excited\nI'm excited to join the Tour De Ricky 200km bike ride for several reasons.\nFirstly, I love the sense of community that comes with participating in a mass cycling event that is not competitive in nature (i.e. it is not a race). I'm looking forward to meeting fellow cyclists, sharing stories, and making new friends.\nSecondly, I'm eager to challenge myself and push my limits. Completing this event will be a huge achievement, and I'm excited to see how far I can push myself. Finally, I'm looking forward to the scenic route and the opportunity to explore new parts of the country.\nThirdly, I have participated in the 100km ride in 2022, and it is still my longest ride so far (~120km). I did not get back to the start within the event's time limit, and I even lost my Brevit! So it was not counted as a success in Audax UK records (although it is a huge success in my personal records), so I am determined to get to the finish line within the time limit this year.\nTraining and Preparation\n\nWhile I'm excited, I'm also aware that this event requires careful preparation and training. Over the coming weeks and months, I will be putting in the miles, honing my cycling skills, and building up my endurance. I will be working on my bike, making sure it's in top condition, and preparing myself mentally and physically for the challenge ahead.\nAbove is a hand drawn/written training calendar that fits my current work schedule (with return to office et al), and hopefully I can manage to finish it. It is not enough, but it will have to do.\nI also discovered that the ride day will be in one of my oncall shifts, so I will have to find a swap for that! :D\nConclusion\nThe Tour De Ricky 200km ride, if successful, will be my first Century Ride, a ride that is a 100 miles long, or more, and will be a dream come true for me. I have done a Metric Centry before, also with Tour De Ricky. I'm excited to be part of this amazing event once again, to challenge myself, and to experience the thrill of long-distance cycling.

If you try it, you will be lonely often, and sometimes frightened.

Don't let anything stand in the way of the light that shines through this form. Risk being seen in all of your glory.\"\n-- Jim Carrey\n\n\n\n\"The chief beauty about time\nis that you cannot waste it in advance.\nThe next year, the next day, the next hour are lying ready for you,\nas perfect, as unspoiled,\nas if you had never wasted or misapplied\na single moment in all your life.\nYou can turn over a new leaf every hour\nif you choose.\"\n-- Arnold Bennett\n\n\n\n\"Your experience of being alive consists of nothing other than the sum of everything to which you pay attention. At the end of your life, looking back,\nwhatever compelled your attention from moment to moment is simply what your life will have been. So when you pay attention to something you don't especially\nvalue, it's not an exaggeration to say you're paying with your life.\"\n-- Oliver Burkeman, Four Thousand Weeks: Time Management for Mortals\n\n","description":"","id":"https://mosab.co.uk/quotes/","path":"/quotes/","title":"Quotes that resonate with me"},"https://mosab.co.uk/recommendations/":{"body":"Here are some recommendations on Linkedin from my colleagues over time:\n\nMosab is deft and friendly geek whom I've known for over a decade before finally working together in\nthe same team.\nMosab possesses an impressive in-depth knowledge powered by relentless desire to dissect and\nunderstand the core of every technology he touches.

My work directly impacts Neon's ability to provide a seamless,\nserverless database experience for developers.\nBefore that, at Meta, I served as a Production Engineer, playing a critical role in protecting the company's core online\ndata infrastructure for Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp. This involved ensuring the reliability and\nresilience of Datastores Backup and Restore systems, safeguarding against data loss and corruption.
