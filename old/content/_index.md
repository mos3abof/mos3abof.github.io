Welcome to my online space! I am a self-taught software and systems engineer with a passion for
database systems, distributed systems, systems programming, operating systems, and open source/free 
software. When I'm not working, you can find me spending time with my lovely family or indulging 
in my hobbies of cycling, cooking and woodworking.
