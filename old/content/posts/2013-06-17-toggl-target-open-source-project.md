At our company, [Yubb Software](http://www.yubb-software.com), we track our
working hours using the great time tracker created by the folks at
[Toggl](http://www.toggl.com), and we have monthly goals that we need to
achieve. I have always had a problem with time management, and this time I
decided I should start working on them.

So I created this small project to calculate how many more hours I should work
to achieve my monthly goals.

This is how the output of this script looks like :

```plaintext
Hi Checking Internet connectivity... Internet seems fine!

Trying to connect to Toggl, hang on!

So far you have tracked 120.00 hours

Business days left till deadline : 7 Total days left till deadline : 10

Required working hours for this month : 170

To achieve the minimum : you should log 4.00 hours every business day or log
3.00 hours every day

To achieve the required : you should log 7.00 hours every business day or log
5.0 hours every day

So far you have achieved:

70.59% [=================================================--------------|------]
```

This information has provided me with a whole new level of awareness of how
productive I am! It is scary, but at the same time it gives you a great
indicator of how good -or bad- you are sticking to your goals and if you need to
have some crunch time or just relax the next weekend.

I then published the script under GPL license V2 on
[Github](https://github.com/mos3abof/toggl_target).

I got great deal of help from one of my role model software engineers in Egypt,
[Mohammed Tayseer](http://www.mtayseer.net/), making the code more Pythonic. He
also added installation instructions for Windows users, as I don't use windows
anymore, and he is now a contributor to the repository on Github.

Today, Monday June 17th, Toggl added a link to my script on their new
documentation in the [Code Examples](https://github.com/toggl/toggl_api_docs)
section.

My little open source script that uses is the first -and so far the only-
mentioned project in their new API Documentation. Check it on their [API
Documentation](https://github.com/toggl/toggl_api_docs#code-examples) on Github,
or check the following screenshot :

This really made my day. Thank you Toggl :)

### Update 1 : Friday June 21st, 3:50 PM

I received an email today from someone with the following content :

> Hi Mosab,

I am really glad my code helped someone :)

### Update 2 : Wednesday Jul 10th, 11:43 PM

Seems that my little Toggl Target script is picking up some momentum.

I got this email 45 minutes ago :

> hi,

> i just wanted to see how fast i could add reports api support and what data
> comes out of there... while doing that i replaced the way the config is loaded

> a user's home dir... and added a setup.py to install everything.
>
> so now there is a separate script to get some reports and an api wrapper for
> reports subclassing yours. i also did a little refactoring in your code.

> since you seem to plan on writing a separate pytoggle lib i thought some of

I am really surprised and humbled by all your contributions, thank you.
