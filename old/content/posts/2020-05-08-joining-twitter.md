Last Friday was my last day at [GoCardless](https://gocardless.com). It has been
a year -and change- full of knowing smart and great colleagues, and learning a
lot from them. Special shout-out to the Core Infrastructure team!

I am super excited that starting next Monday I will be joining
[Twitter](https://twitter.com)'s Site Reliability Engineering team
[@TwitterSRE](https://twitter.com/TwitterSRE) in London! I have met some of the
team already, and can't wait to start working with them and meet the rest!

This is a huge step for me, and I look forward to months and years of hard
working, learning and making new friends while empowering everyone in the world
to create and share ideas and information instantly without barriers!
