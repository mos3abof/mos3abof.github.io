Today, I was the guest in one of my favourite podcasts in Arabic:
["null++"](https://nullplus.plus/). It is my favourite for two reasons:

1. One of the two co-hosts is a dear friend of mine, and I hope I become friends with the other
   co-host as well. Both co-hosts are active in the tech scene in Egypt, and are very competent
   engineers.
2. The podcast is a valuable resource for people in Egypt interested in the tech scene, especially
   new comers, to know not only the latest trends and best practices, but also have some guidance
   along the way to get there.
