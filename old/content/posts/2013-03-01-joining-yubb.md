I am very excited to join [Yubb Software](http://www.yubb-software.com), a
brilliant software development company.

I have worked with the founders and some of the workers there in previous
companies, and I love this group. The project we are working on is challenging,
and the role I am supposed to play is very interesting.

They are working from a co-working space called [The
District](http://www.district-egypt.com/), which is even more cool :)

I am looking forward for a bunch of hard working months to come.
