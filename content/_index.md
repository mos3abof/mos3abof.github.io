Welcome to my online space! I am a self-taught software and systems engineer with a passion for
database systems, distributed systems, systems programming, Linux, and open source/free software.
When I'm not working, you can find me spending time with my lovely family or indulging in my 
hobbies of cycling and woodworking.
