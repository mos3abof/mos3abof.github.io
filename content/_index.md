Welcome to my humble place on the internet! I am a passionate self-taught software & systems
engineer, a father to two lovely kids, a husband to an [amazing wife](https://amiraqassim.com),
supposedly a geek, a caffeine junkie, a food lover, and an open source/free software believer. My
hobbies include cycling and woodworking.

Originally from Cairo, Egypt & living in the United Kingdom.
