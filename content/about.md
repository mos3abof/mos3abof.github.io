I am a passionate self-taught software engineer (and lately site reliability engineer), a father to
two lovely kids, a husband to an [amazing wife](https://amiraqassim.com), supposedly a geek, a
caffeine junkie, a food lover, an open source/free software believer, and in a love/hate
relationship with running. Originally from Cairo, Egypt. Currently living in the United Kingdom.
