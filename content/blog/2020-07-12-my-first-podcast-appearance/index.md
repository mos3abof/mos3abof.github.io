I have recently received an invitation from my dear friend [Ahmed Zain](https://iahmadzain.me/), who
runs a very interesting podcast under the name of "Tech and Coffee", that is generally made for
sharing experiences around tech and, you guessed it, coffee!

This is the first time I participate in a podcast, and it was a humbling experience. We talked about
many things; How I started in tech, how my career developed over time, what it means to be an SRE,
my journey from Egypt to Germany, and finally the United Kingdom, as well as other topics. The
podcast and the episode are in Arabic.
