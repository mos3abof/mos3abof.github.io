I have been suffering for a while with IDEs, and ventured out to see what
options do I have. I ended up using mainly Vim and Sublime for a long while now,
and my life was never easier and I was never happier! In this post however I am
talking about my [Sublime Text][] Setup.

### 1) Package Control {#1-package-control}

You don't know what sublime is really capable of until you install the "[Package
Control][]".

The website describes it as:

> A full-featured package manager that helps discovering, installing, updating
> and removing packages for Sublime Text 2. It features an automatic upgrader
> and supports GitHub, Bitbucket and a full channel/repository system.

If you are using Sublime and not using it, STOP READING & NOW GO
[INSTALL IT][]! After that go have a look [how to use it][].

### 2) The packages I use {#2-the-packages-i-use}

I have a list of awesome packages I use:

- **SublimeLinter** : Uses "lint" programs to highlight lines of code the
  linter deems to contain (potential) errors. It also supports highlighting
  special annotations (for example: TODO) so that they can be quickly located.
- **SideBarEnhancements** : Adds lots of enhancements to default Sublime Text
  sidebar. Files and folders.
- **GitHubinator** : Allows you to select text in a Sublime Text 2 file, and
  see the highlighted lines on GitHub's remote repo, if one exists.
- **Git** : Plugin for some git integration into Sublime Text.
- **Djaneiro** : Django support for Sublime Text.
- **SublimeCodeIntel** : Full-featured code intelligence and smart
  autocomplete engine.
- **PHP-Twig** : Adds support for `.twig` template files.
- **BracketHilighter** : Matches and highlights a variety of brackets for
  better readability.
- **SublimeRope** : Adds Python completions and some IDE-like functions to
  Sublime Text.
- **jQuery** : Provides help with jQuery functions.
- **Xdebug** : Xdebug Interface for Sublime Text.
- **SublimeREPL** : Helps you run an interpreter inside Sublime Text for
  various languages (like Python, Ruby, Shell) and you can configure it to run
  others as well.

To install any of these packages -after installing the Package Control- press
`ctrl+shift+p` then type `install package`. A list will appear with all
available packages to your, just click on the package you want and voila!

I highly recommend you watch this video on Youtube : [Perfect Workflow in
Sublime Text 2][]. It might seem very long, but it is actually divided into 10
minutes chunks -more or less- and it is one of the best resources I have seen
about Sublime.

Happy hacking/coding with Sublime :)
