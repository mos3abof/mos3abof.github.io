With two decades of experience as a Software & Systems Engineer, I've built a career on designing, deploying, and
maintaining high-performance systems at scale. My journey has taken me through diverse industries and some of the
world's most demanding environments, including Meta (Facebook) and Twitter.

My passion lies in solving intricate problems related to large-scale systems, Linux, databases, systems programming,
distributed systems, and automation. I'm a strong advocate for free and open-source software, believing in the power of
collaborative innovation.

As an infra engineer at [Neon.tech](https://neon.tech) (now acquired by [Databricks](https://databricks.com), I play a crucial role in ensuring the reliability, scalability, and
performance of our cloud-native PostgreSQL platform (aka Lakebase). I collaborate with cross-functional engineering teams to manage our
multi-region, multi-cloud deployments, focusing on automating operational tasks, optimizing infrastructure, and
proactively identifying and mitigating potential issues. My work directly impacts Neon's ability to provide a seamless,
serverless database experience for developers.

Before that, at Meta, I served as a Production Engineer, playing a critical role in protecting the company's core online
data infrastructure for Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp. This involved ensuring the reliability and
resilience of Datastores Backup and Restore systems, safeguarding against data loss and corruption. Prior to Meta, As a
Senior SRE on the [Database SRE team at Twitter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQQTRE48sw8), I managed the company's core database infrastructure. My experience also
includes impactful SRE and Software Engineering roles at innovative startups like GoCardless, Levelset, and other
dynamic companies where I consistently delivered results.

I'm driven by a desire to continuously learn and push the boundaries of what's possible. I'm always seeking new
challenges and opportunities to leverage my expertise and make a meaningful impact.
