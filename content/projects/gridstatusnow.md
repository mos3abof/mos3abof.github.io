Egypt's Power Grid Load Status As A Web Service. A service parses the data in
the Load Meter provided by The Egyptian Electric Utility and Consumer Protection
Regulatory Agency (EGYPTERA) and presents it in a more human friendly way. It
also provides an API so other developers can build other web and mobile
applications on top of it.
