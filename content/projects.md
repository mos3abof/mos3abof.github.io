Below is a list of some of my projects. Check my Github profile for more.

## Grid Status Now

Egypt's Power Grid Load Status As A Web Service. A service parses the data in
the Load Meter provided by The Egyptian Electric Utility and Consumer Protection
Regulatory Agency (EGYPTERA) and presents it in a more human friendly way. It
also provides an API so other developers can build other web and mobile
applications on top of it.

## Toggle Target

At work, long time ago, we had to track our working hours on Toggl
(www.toggl.com), so I created this small project to calculate how many hours I
should work to achieve my monthly goals.

## Dir2HTML

Dir2Html is a python utility that generates an album html page out of a

generated using the tool.

## Power Close

A firefox addon, for the tab addict, to close all tabs with a domain name. For
example, if you have many facebook tabs open and not in order, you can just use
this addon, write "facebook.com", hit enter and voila, all facebook tabs are now
closed! Code is on github.
